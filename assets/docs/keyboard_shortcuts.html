<h2 id="within-text-areas-and-text-fields">Within text areas and text fields</h2>
<p>Aside from normal one-letter shortcuts for the actions, Helium also supports keyboard shortcuts <em>inside a text area or a text field</em>, which can be used while editing. The trick is to use the <code>&lt;Enter&gt;</code> button on your keyboard as a modifier key - similar to how you <code>&lt;Ctrl&gt;+S</code> to save a document on Windows (or <code>&lt;Cmd&gt;+S</code> on Mac), you press <code>&lt;Enter&gt;+S</code> to save a buffer inside Helium.</p>
<p>To view supported <em>modified</em> keys, you can press <code>&lt;Enter&gt;+&lt;Backspace&gt;</code> (use your thumb) inside any text field/area to bring up the complete list of keys recognized by <em>that</em> field/area. Most of the time it includes the same keys used for the actions, but it might also include special keys that can be useful e.g. <code>&lt;Enter&gt;+D</code> to delete the current line, <code>&lt;Enter&gt;+V</code> to paste.</p>
<h2 id="within-each-tab-while-nothing-is-focused">Within each tab, while nothing is focused</h2>
<p>Helium allows for keyboard navigation of the buffer being edited, when nothing is focused inside the tab i.e. no text field or area is focused.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;Space&gt;</code>: move the cursor down by a page</li>
<li><code>&lt;Shift&gt;+&lt;Space&gt;</code>: move the cursor up by a page</li>
<li><code>U</code>: move the cursor up by a page</li>
<li><code>J</code>: move the cursor one line down</li>
<li><code>K</code>: move the cursor one line up</li>
</ul>
<p>Navigation in this way takes care of partial highlight (as compared to scrolling inside the text area, which requires you to tap at the desired location to place the cursor there and trigger the highlight).</p>
<p><em>Note: if the cursor is still within viewable area after any of these actions then there won't be any visible change - because a text area only updates its displayed area when the cursor is out of view. This is a limitation in Blackberry SDK.</em></p>
<p>Additionally, <code>&lt;Enter&gt;</code> key brings you to the most appropriate editable field inside the tab:</p>
<ul>
<li>when the main text area is empty, this is the title field</li>
<li>when the main text area is not empty, this is the main text field</li>
<li>when <strong>Find &amp; Replace</strong> is active, this is the find field</li>
</ul>
